### Python Education Resources, Use Cases, and Miscellaneous Didactic Materials

## Introduction  
  
This repository aims to serve as a reference of materials to learn and practice Python in the context of data science and/or machine learning. The materials contained within this repository target a diverse audience of Python users, including first-time Python users and those with previous experience. If you are a first-time user, the curated resources will contain information that will help you install Python and Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda and begin familiarizing yourself with Python's syntax and data structures. Students more familiar with Python may jump into topic-specific resources as refreshers and references or even jump directly into simulated use cases to practice their skills in an applied scenario! Below are summaries of the two main arms of this repository:  

### Use Cases

The `Use Cases` folder contains a number of sub-folders. Each sub-folder contains a "Use Case", which can be thought of as an example assignment. Assignments include a data set or multiple data sets to use in answering questions contained in a `Student Assessment.MD` file in each folder. These assignments outline specific competencies that they intend to assess. 

- An assignment promp (`Student Assessment.MD`): This markdown document will contain all relevant questions and information (outside of the CSV data files mentioned below) to "complete" a use case assignment. This document will include a brief introduction to the use case topic, relevant resources/references when appropriate, and tasks/questions to complete/answer for each use case.  
- CSV data file(s): Data files relevant for completion of the assignment/use case  
- A walkthrough Jupyter notebook "solution": A Jupyter notebook of **a** walkthrough solution to the student assessment prompts. As noted in each use case, this walkthrough notebook does not necessarily present a singular correct solution (or even necessarily the most concise   
- An additional `Instructor Materials` subfolder: This folder is not relevant for the completion or understanding of any assessments, as it simply contains relevant figures/files presented in the `Student Assessment.MD` as well as a Jupyter Notebook simulating data for each use case (when applicable).   
- An `R` folder, containing walkthrough RMD and HTML documents generated in R (using RMarkdown) that walk through steps paralleling the walkthrough Jupyter Notebooks. These files  will not be fully introductory to R (assuming some base familiarity) but are instructive in assuming only a basic understanding of R before then walking through the student assessment "solutions".   
  
*We would love to hear and implement additional, relevant use cases from instructors, statisticians, pharmacists, and other analytics professionals! If you have a relevant use case you would be comfortable sharing, please visit [following Google form](https://forms.gle/crQJqGNvyjGpJa9y7) and submit a brief proposal, describing your use case.*

### Resource Curation

The current document contains, below this Introduction section, a running list of Python resources. We hope that this list may serve as a quick reference for LinkedInLearning or YouTube lectures, written references, and/or other open-resource websites. These resources are additionally contained under the file `Resource Spreadsheet.MD`. This file organizes the resources as they pertain to different topics related to the Python for Data Management & Analytics course (although these topics certainly extend to building competencies in Python for data science outside of the course as well)!  See the the list below for an aggregated (and growing) collection of resources:
