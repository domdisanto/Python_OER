The materials contained within this repository target a diverse audience of Python users, including first-time Python users and those with previous experience. If you are a first-time user, the curated resources will contain information that will help you install Python and Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda and begin familiarizing yourself with Pythons syntax and data structures. Students more familiar with Python may jump into topic-specific resources as refreshers and references or even jump directly into simulated use cases to practice their skills in an applied scenario! Below are summaries of the two main arms of this repository: 2.1 Use Cases The Use Cases folder contains a number of sub-folders. Each sub-folder contains a Use Case, which can be thought of as an example assignment. Assignments include a data set or multiple data sets to use in answering questions contained in a Student Assessment.MD file in each folder. These assignments outline specific competencies that they intend to assess. An assignment prompt (Student Assessment.MD): This markdown document will contain all relevant questions and information (outside of the CSV data files mentioned below) to complete a use case assignment. This document will include a brief introduction to the use case topic, relevant resources/references when appropriate, and tasks/questions to complete/answer for each use case. CSV data file(s): Data files relevant for completion of the assignment/use case A walkthrough Jupyter notebook solution: A Jupyter notebook of a walkthrough solution to the student assessment prompts. As noted in each use case, this walkthrough notebook does not necessarily present a singular correct solution (or even necessarily the most concise An additional Instructor Materials subfolder: This folder is not relevant for the completion or understanding of any assessments, as it simply contains relevant figures/files presented in the Student Assessment.MD as well as a Jupyter Notebook simulating data for each use case (when applicable). An R folder, containing walkthrough RMD and HTML documents generated in R (using RMarkdown) that walk through steps paralleling the walkthrough Jupyter Notebooks. These files will not be fully introductory to R (assuming some base familiarity) but are instructive in assuming only a basic understanding of R before then walking through the student assessment solutions. We would love to hear and implement additional, relevant use cases from instructors, statisticians, pharmacists, and other analytics professionals! If you have a relevant use case you would be comfortable sharing, please visit following Google form and submit a brief proposal, describing your use case. 2.2 Resource Curation Chapter 3 of this book is solely a running list of relevant, Python resources. We hope that this list may serve as a quick reference for LinkedInLearning or YouTube lectures, written references, and/or other open-resource websites. These resources are additionally contained under the file Resource Spreadsheet.MD. This file organizes the resources as they pertain to different topics related to the Python for Data Management &amp; Analytics course (although these topics certainly extend to building competencies in Python for data science outside of the course as well)!

PTSD Research Cohort Possible Patients PTSD Data 5.2 Assignment 5.2.1 Introduction The present use case uses a simulated data set of patients with PTSD and suicidal-ideation or suicidal-related behavior (SRB) outcome data. This data and use case are inspired by the work of Noah Delapaz and William Hor under Dr. Lirong Wang related to pharmaceutical treatment of PTSD and related, adverse suicidal ideation. In this use case, you will first be given a large list of patients and previous ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnoses, within which you will identify a patient sample of interest with a diagnosis of PTSD (as if you were identifying a study sample in the early stages of a research project). After identifying your study sample of interest, you will use patient outcome and medication data to assess the effects of common PTSD-treatments on later diagnosis of PTSD and/or SRB. Steps will include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model-building and evaluation as you work with this use case. 5.2.1.1 Competencies Modules: 1 (Importing/Reading Data); 4 (Pandas Intro); 5 (Relational Data/Data Merging); 6 (Data Cleaning); Assorted Classification Modules Competencies: Pandas (general); Data merging; Matplotlib/Visualization (basic, general); Cleaning string data; Cleaning inconsistently coded data; Sci-kit learn; Model fitting and cross-validation; Various possible classification model algorithms 5.2.1.2 Cohort Identification The dataset PossiblePatients_ICD.csv contains a list of ~1,000 patients from a hypothetical electronic health record registry with various ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes. We want to identify adult patients (18+) with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. We will use the codes of 309.81, F43.10, F43.11, F43.12 to identify our diagnosis of interest. How many patients do you find in this data set that are eligible for your research study (i.e that meet this criteria)? 5.2.1.3 Data Cleaning &amp; Exploratory Analysis Now we will work with the file PTSD_ResearchCohort.csv, a dataset of the 401 patients who were recruited and successfully completed our hypothetical study. A data dictionary is included below for reference: Data Dictionary Variable Description PTSD_Q1-PTSD_Q20 PTSD Questionnaire variables (see images below) describing presence of symptoms 6-months after study enrollment PHQ_Q9 Patient Health Questionnaire (or PHQ-9) question 9, which assessed presence of suicidality or ideation of suicide, also at 6-months after study enrollment Age Continuous (integer) age variable TimeFirstDiagnosis_Months Integer value. The number of months since the patients first diagnosis of PTSD AlcAbuse Binary variable, where 1 represents present alcohol abuse and 0 no alcohol abuse over the previous 6 months BeckAnxiety_BL Continuous measure ranging from 0-63, where higher values indicate greater presence and severity of anxiety symptoms IncomeCat Nominal categorical varible describing income category relative to the federal poverty line (described in the variables categories) SocialSupport Self-reported social support, with values ranging from 0 to 84, where higher values indicate higher self-reported social support PTSD_Rx Name of medication prescribed Import the research study data. We can assume that the patients in this data file are a sbuset of the eligible patients you identified above. How many patients that you identified in question 1 have available outcome data? How many were not recruited or have missing follow-up data (i.e. are not in this outcome data set)? Using the PTSD questionnaire vairiables, crate a binary PTSD diagnosis/outcome variable. The following links include useful resources the PTSD checklist and respective variable coding and a guide to the scoring and diagnosis of PTSD using this checklist, with relevant information included below in Figures 1A and 1B. Figure 1A Figure 1B Create a variable that identifies suicidal ideation as present or absent: See the following article as a reference describing the PHQ9 questions. The 9th question in PHQ9 is often used to assess suicidality, with any values &gt;1 (i.e. present symptom) indicating suicidal endorsement/ideation and is contained in your data set. Beyond the PTSD &amp; PHQ variables, examine the other variables in the data set, and their descriptions in the Data Dictionary above. For any categorical variables, create indicator/dummy variables. 5.2.1.4 Build your model Build a model on the training set predicting 6-month SRB and predicting 6-month PTSD diagnosis using the input features dentified in the data dictionary and that youve prepared in the data cleaning section above of age, time since earliest PTSD diagnosis, alcohol abuse, Beck Anxiety Inventory, alcohol abuse, income category, social support, and medication indicator variables. Select a modelling algorithm that allows you to examine feature importance. Assess the fit of both your models What medications are important in a predictive model of PTSD? Describe the relationship of each medication (generally) based on the level of evidence (say high or low) based on your interpretation of the results of your model. What type of model did you fit and what specific measure did you use in 3a to assess importance? List two other types of classification models and how you would assess feature importance for these different models. 5.3 Solutions Jupyter Notebook Walkthrough R/RMarkdown Walkthrough "],["use-case-accessing-the-fdas-faers-data.html", "Chapter 6 Use Case: Accessing the FDAs FAERS Data 6.1 Materials 6.2 Assignment 6.3 Solutions", " Chapter 6 Use Case: Accessing the FDAs FAERS Data 6.1 Materials Solution Checker (see description in Assignment section below) 6.2 Assignment 6.2.0.1 Competencies Modules: 1 (Importing/Reading Data); 4 (Pandas Intro); 5 (Relational Data/Data Merging); 6 (Data Cleaning) Competencies: Pandas (general); Data merging 6.2.1 Introduction &amp; Tasks Taken from the FDAs website: The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is a database that contains adverse event reports, medication error reports and product quality complaints resulting in adverse events that were submitted to FDA. The database is designed to support the FDAs post-marketing safety surveillance program for drug and therapeutic biologic products. This use case involves accessing the FAERS data from the FDAs website. We will specifically only be interested in the tables related to the drugs involved in each reported event. We will also limit the assignment to a single medication to reduce the size of the data you will manipulate and export. The FAERS data source is a rich resource of much more information than is explored through this use case, and youre encouraged to examine the data outside of the task presented below! 6.2.2 Tasks Access the FDAs Adverse Events Reporting System Data (FAERS) data, and pull all drug events related to Phenytoin from the datas DRUGS files for fiscal year 2019 (or FY2019). Aggregate FY2019 data into a single xlsx data file titlted FY2019_Phenytoin_FAERS_Python.xlsx or FY2019_Phenytoin_FAERS_R.xlsx for each respective program. Please leave all columns/variables in the data set, only filtering rows/observations for adverse drug events related to Phenytoin. This data is publicily accessible, such that you can download and import the files from a local folder. As the data are publicily hosted, the following StackOverflow post may be useful to review to attempt extracting data directly from the FDAs website using the zipfile, requests, and io Python modules. The included Python script FAERS_SolutionCheck.py will check your supplied solutions for accuracy, by simply running the code: &gt; exec(open(AERS_SolutionCheck.py).read()) in your Jupyter notebook. The presented task for this assignment is intentionally very vague. The walkthrough Jupyter notebook and RMarkdown documents will discuss both the programmatic solution with coding examples and the data access for the FAERS data. Youre encourage to do your best to download, explore, access, etc. the data on your own as much as possible to create the final aggregate data set. 6.3 Solutions Jupyter Notebook Walkthrough RMarkdown Walkthrough "]]
