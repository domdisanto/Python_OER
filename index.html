	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
  This website serves as a brief introduction to the Python Open Education Repository (OER) being developed by Ravi Patel &amp; Dominic DiSanto within the University of Pittsburgh's 
  School of Pharmacy. The materials referenced and linked to on this page are currently hosted publicily in a <a href="https://github.com/domdisanto/Python_OER/">GitHub repository</a>.
  Below we outline the materials included in this repository as a brief summary of the available resources! This project aims to serve as a reference of materials to learn and practice 
  Python in the context of data science and/or machine learning in the pharmaceutical sciences. Our hope is that these lessons generalize beyond PharmacoAnalytics to help any user learn Python effectively!
  The materials contained within this repository target a diverse audience of Python users, including first-time Python users and those with previous experience.
	      </p>

	        <h2> Use Cases: </h2>
	      <p>
	      This repository contains a number of <i>Use Cases</i>, that is assignments that present users with data that represents a common and/or useful task they may face
	      in their careers in academic research, quality assurance analysis, 
	      These uses cases are gleaned from previously published research and often in collaboration with academic and industry partners, who have shared their work 
	      as pharmacists and/or analysts to help us craft assignments that help users not only build their Python competencies (and confidence) but also gain experience
	      in projects relevant to their desired career paths!
