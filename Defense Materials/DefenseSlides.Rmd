# Introduction & Background


## Objectives 

- **Primary Objective**: Transform a large number of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes into a sparse set of features, using treelet dimension reduction, and apply this new feature space towards the prediction of clinical outcomes of in-hospital mortality, unplanned hospital re-admission, and hospital length of stay. 

<br>

- **Public Health Significance**: The presented work leverages a large, publicly accessible database of critical care admissions and generate useful predictive models of clinical outcomes using only patient demographic and comorbidity diagnosis information.


## Clinical Prediction Models

- Present useful, and ideally generalizable, methods to measure patient risk of adverse, clinical outcomes

<br>

- Current prediction models of mortality, length of stay, and unplanned re-admission have limited performance and utility  

<br>

- Useful models not only demonstrate high prediction accuracy but ideally require *"feasible"* data 
    - Inexpensive
    - Non-invasive
    - Standardized


## Modern Healthcare Data 

- Digitization of clinical data (such as in an electronic healthcare record) has led to large volumes of patient-level data

<br>

- Large, publicily available  data sets are growing source of clinical reserach data, including both:
    + Diverse patient populations 
    + Robust data elements for each respective patient
  





## Dimension Reduction 

- Models that allow a number of <footnote content="Also commonly referred to as inputs, covariates, features, etc."> data elements</footnote> to be represented by a smaller number of inputs 

<br>

- Methods often use the correlation structure to represent "similar" covariates in a reduced number of inputs

<br>

- Commonly discussed in the context of high-dimensional biological data (e.g. genomic, metabolomic) 


## Treelet 

- A novel dimension reduction method proposed by Ann Lee, Boaz Nadler, and Larry Wasserman in <footnote content="Lee, A. B., Nadler, B., & Wasserman, L. (2008). Treelets—An adaptive multi-scale basis for sparse unordered data. The Annals of Applied Statistics, 2(2), 435–471. https://doi.org/10.1214/07-AOAS137">2008</footnote>

<br>

- Previously improved performance of regression and classification models compared to "raw" input data 

<br>

- Has yet to be applied in high-dimensional patient-level comorbidity data or in fitting of clinical prediction models


# Data

## MIMIC-III

- A <footnote content="MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. Johnson AEW, Pollard TJ, Shen L, Lehman L, Feng M, Ghassemi M, Moody B, Szolovits P, Celi LA, and Mark RG. Scientific Data (2016). DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2016.35. Available from: http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635 ">publicily available</footnote> database of critical care admissions 

<br>

- Prospective cohort study of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center critical care admissions from 2001 to 2012

<br>

- Contains diagnosis, lab, and demographic information from 60,000 admissions in over 45,000 patients 


## ICD-9-CM Diagnosis Codes 

- International Classification of Disease, 9th Version 

<br>

- Coding system of disease and injury diagnosis used in hospital billing

<br>

- Over 17,000 unique codes describing various patient diagnoses 

<br>

- The presented analysis included only ICD-9-CM codes with $\geq1\%$ prevalence in our full, analytic cohort


## Outcomes

- In-hospital mortality

<br>

- Unplanned hospital re-admission
  - Captured within year of hospital discharge
  - Analysis excluded patients who died post-discharge with no hospital re-admission

<br>

- Total hospital length of stay 
  - Measured in days


## Covariates

- Primary focus on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes (following treelet dimension reduction)

<br>

- Models controlled for patient demographic variables
  - Age
  - Sex
    - Genotypical sex of patient (Male, Female)
  - Insurance 
    - Categorized as Medicare, Medicaid, Private Insurance, or Self-Pay


## Analytic Cohort 

- Final analysis of mortality and hospital length of stay included 38,554 patients
    + Mortality rate of 14.49% (n=5,586)
    + Median length of stay was 7 days (range of 1-295 days)  
  
<br>
  
- Hospital readmission analysis included 28,894
  + Excluding 9,660 patients who died within one-year of discharge without re-admission
  + 2,153 (7.45%) of patients experienced unplanned re-admission
  


# Statistical Analyses 


## Overview

- Applied treelet dimension reduction to ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes
     
<br>
    
- Used cross-validation of GLMs to identify values of treelet parameters $K$-dimensionality and $L|K$-basis matrix  
     + Logistic regression for in-hospital mortality, hospital-readmission
     + Negative binomial regression for hospital length of stay 
     
<br>

- Final model fit measures were assessed on our hold-out test data-set (20% of each analytic cohort)


## Treelet

- Using the covariance matrix of our input data, performs a series of <footnote content="Equivalent to fitting local PCA on the input features of highest covariance">rotations</footnote>, grouping together features of high covariance 

- For $p$ input predictors, treelet constructs $p-1$ basis matrices (or $B_{L_1}, B_{L_2}, .... B_{L_{p-1}}$) of dimensions $p\times k$

- The final representation requires identifying a value for the the $K$ parameter (for $K$ retained inputs in the $Lth$ basis matrix)
     - For a given $K$, there is an identifiable cut-off ($L^*|K$) and respective basis ($B_{L^*|K}$) using the normalized energy score proposed by Lee et al.
     

## Cross-Validation

- Models are fit to "training" sets and performance assessed on "test" sets
    + Logistic regression classification accuracy was assessed by Brier's Score $\frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1} \left( \hat{p}_i - y_i\right)^2$
    + Negative binomial fit by root-mean-square error $\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1} \left( \hat{y}_i - y_i\right)^2}$

<br>

- The presented analyses used 5-fold cross-validation to select $K$ and $L|K$ parameters for treelet models
    + Final model performance was assessed on a holdout test data set that was *not* used in cross-validation or model fitting 


## Overview (revisited)

- Applied treelet dimension reduction to ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes
     
<br>
    
- Used cross-validation of GLMs to identify $K$-dimensionality and $L|K$ basis matrix parameters for each outcome
     + Logistic regression for in-hospital mortality, hospital-readmission
     + Negative binomial regression for hospital length of stay 
     
<br>

- Final model fit measures were assessed on our hold-out test data-set (20% of each analytic cohort)

## Mortality (Summary)

- Treelet reduction (and cross-validation) did *not* yield a sparse feature space
     + $K=123$ dimensions retained loadings from all 178 diagnosis codes

```


## Readmission (Summary)

- Treelet improved performance but still presented only limited discrimination of hospital re-admission
     + While cross-validation reduced our 178 diagnosis codes covariates into $K=30$ variables, we again retained loadings from all codes

## Length of Stay (Summary)

- Treelet identified a reduced dimensionality and a sparse feature set
     + The retained $K=46$ variables from our treelet model including loadings from 107 of our 178 ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes

<br>

|Model|Test RMSE|

# Implications & Conclusions


## Summary 

- ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes improve predictive performance of in-hospital mortality, but remain limited in their ability to predict hospital length of stay and re-admission

<br>

- Additional information (e.g. patient discharge disposition, social determinants of health, patient environment data) may be necessary to adequately predict post-discharge outcomes

<br>

- Treelet dimension reduction reduces the number of retained covariates in our models but does not outperform PCA, LASSO  

## Objectives (Revisited)

- **Primary Objective**: Transform a large number of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes into a sparse set of features, using treelet dimension reduction, and apply this new feature space towards the prediction of clinical outcomes of in-hospital mortality, unplanned hospital re-admission, and hospital length of stay. 

<br>

- **Public Health Significance**: The presented work leverages a large, publicly accessible database of critical care admissions and generate useful predictive models of clinical outcomes using only patient demographic and comorbidity diagnosis information.
