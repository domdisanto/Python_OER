Remaining thoughts/tasks to improve use case:

Add temporality, within weeks or days as well as seasonality. This is something discussed that mirrors practice, but simply hasn't yet been done in the data simulation. I think this is the natural next step to make our data further mirror St. Jude's and take the case beyond just a tabulation of frequent stock-outs but a relative calculation/exploration of trends

Add superfluous data elements (provider ID, outpat/inpat, other columns that are unnecessary but could serve as red herrings for having users/students try to identify trends in stock-out frequency)

Frequency of stock-outs was assigned arbitrarily by Dom (may not mirror actual magnitudes in practice). These can be easily changed by updating the dictionaries in the code set-up
